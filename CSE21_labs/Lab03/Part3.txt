1. a) it'll say that it cannot reassign the final value.
   b) "names" is string, "prices" is double, "amounts" is double.
   c) 13 entries for "prices", 10 for "names", 12 for "amounts"
   d) names[3] = 1; //is invalid (cannot assign integer to a string type)
   e)   Cheese A10
	Cheese A10
        Cheese 6510
	Cheese K
	Cheese 75
   f) i = 3 because the first 3 elements are already assigned.

2. Copied a lot of tiny fragments, because then I understand how should I fit it into my code.

3. The whole thing.

4. 6 loops

5. 5 for loops, 1 while loop
