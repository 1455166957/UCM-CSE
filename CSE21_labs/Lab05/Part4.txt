1) Long
2) arr.length should be greater that max.
3) Long
4) To get rid of values from previous method.
5) for the 1st fib method I used int. For the second one long (because of the array type).
6) Because we need to know previous two values to get the current one.
7) Long. int is not enough.
8) Because we need to set the first value to 1.
9) Because int isn't enough to store factorials.
10) It doesn't work because array with length of 10 isn't enough. It's possible to fix it with 'if' statement that prevents using non existing array slot.
